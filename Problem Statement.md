## PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Harry has grown up to be a successful enterpreneur due to his hard work and perserverance. Besides these qualities, he is kind and polite too. One day, he decides to buy and distribute candies among the poor children of his city. Initially(on day 0), he has no candies. He decides to collect candies for next n days and then distribute them. On the next two days, he buys one candy on each day. Then onwards, he orders the shopkeeper to deliver some candies to him each day such that on a given day the number of candies delivered is equal to the sum of candies delivered on previous two days. After n days, his secretary brings him the list of m poor children in the city. Harry wants to distribute the candies equally among the children such that no candy is left over. Can you help Harry in solving this problem by telling the number of candies which would be left over after distributing the candies equally among the children?

### INPUT
#### First line would contain two integers: n(1 < n < 10^14) and m(1 < m < 1001).

### OUTPUT
#### Print the number of candies which will be left after distributing those candies(fractional candies and sharing from one candy is unfortunately not allowed :()

### NOTE: The constraints on the value of n might not allow you to direct find the total number of candies exactly and then divide by m. So think wisely. (Since Harry is so kind, He might reward you too ;)

## EXAMPLES:-

### Input_1 : 239 1000
### Output_1 : 161
